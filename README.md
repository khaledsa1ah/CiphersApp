# CiphersApp

This is a command-line program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using various cipher methods. You can choose from a range of ciphers, including the Affine cipher, Caesar cipher, Atbash cipher, Vigenère cipher, Baconian cipher, Simple Substitution cipher, Polybius Square cipher, Morse Code cipher, XOR cipher, and Rail Fence cipher.


## Usage

Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with the available cipher methods. Simply enter the corresponding number of the cipher method you want to use. The program will then guide you through the encryption or decryption process, depending on the selected cipher.


## Cipher Methods

The Cipher Program offers a variety of classical ciphers for encrypting and decrypting messages. Choose from the following cipher methods:

- **Affine**: A substitution cipher that combines the functions of the Caesar cipher and the multiplicative cipher.
- **Caesar**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.
- **Atbash**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by its mirror image in the alphabet.
- **Vigenère**: A polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword to determine different Caesar cipher shift values for each letter.
- **Baconian**: A substitution cipher that uses a binary code to represent each letter of the plaintext.
- **Simple Substitution**: A substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a different letter from the alphabet.
- **Polybius Square**: A substitution cipher that uses a 5x5 grid to map each letter of the plaintext to a pair of coordinates.
- **Morse Code**: A cipher that represents letters and digits as a series of dots and dashes.
- **XOR**: A cipher that performs an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on each character of the plaintext using a given key.
- **Rail Fence**: A transposition cipher that writes the plaintext in a zigzag pattern and then reads off each row to form the ciphertext.
